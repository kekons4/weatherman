# weatherman
This is Homework 6 of the OSU coding bootcamp

## Description
In this project I created a working city weather search app. When the user searches for the city of their choice they are displayed with todays weather aswell as the 5 day forecast. It gives the user information like tempurature, humidity, wind speed, uv index, and what the skies are like.
